# 🚀 Just Deployed: CityPulse AI - Market Intelligence Agent

I'm excited to share my latest project, **CityPulse AI**! 🏙️

It's an **Agentic Data Pipeline** that automates market research. Instead of manually searching Google Maps for hours, this agent autonomously scrapes, analyzes, and visualizes local business data to find market gaps and opportunities.

**🔗 Live Demo:** [Launch App](https://citypulse-ai-market-intelligence-agent-brx9qtzetkcsa5f4ce4skr.streamlit.app/)
**💻 Source Code:** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/akshayev/CityPulse-AI-Market-Intelligence-Agent)

### 🧩 System Architecture
This is a full-stack data engineering project built with:
*   **Engine**: Python & Pandas for statistical analysis.
*   **Scraper**: Dual-mode engine (SerpApi for production, Selenium for fallback).
*   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for cloud storage.
*   **Frontend**: Streamlit for the interactive dashboard.
*   **Vis**: Plotly & Mapbox for geospatial insights.

### 💡 Key Features
*   **Real-Time Scouting**: Fetches live data for any city (e.g., "Gyms in Kochi").
*   **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualizes business density and location clusters.
*   **Lead Generation**: Automatically identifies businesses missing a digital presence (No Website/Phone).
*   **Statistical Insights**: Instantly calculates average ratings, review volume, and market saturation.
